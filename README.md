### 1. Password Strength Classifier
Create a Password Strength Classifier that delivers users a precise evaluation of their password strength. Ensure the classifier functions seamlessly across widely spoken languages worldwide. Additionally, incorporate features that offer users suggestions on enhancing their password according to industry standards, and make them aware of the specific risks linked to their current password.

### 2. Malicious URL Detection System
Create a platform employing deep learning, feature extraction, and classification methods to analyze the content of a given URL for any anomalies or malicious elements. Guarantee that the platform assesses the risk associated with users accessing the website and offers clear reasons behind the identified risk.
